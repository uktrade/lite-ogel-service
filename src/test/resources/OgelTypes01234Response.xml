          <NAME>Access Overseas to Software and Technology for Military Goods: Individual Use Only</NAME>
          <DESCRIPTION>
            <p align="justify">Open General Export Licences (OGELs) allow the export of specified controlled items by any exporter, removing the need for them to apply for an individual licence, provided the shipment and destinations are eligible and the conditions are met. Each OGEL contains conditions about the type and destinations of goods that may be exported and exporters should check these on each licence before using it. This OGEL allows , subject to certain conditions, people who would normally be based in the UK, but who are temporarily based abroad, and authorised by their employer, to access their company's technology and IT systems in the UK, via laptops if appropriate, in connection with their company's business. Exporters must register with the Export Control Organisation before they make use of most OGELs. All Open General Licences remain in force until they are revoked.</p>

            <p align="justify">Open General Export Licences (OGELs) allow the export of specified controlled items by any exporter, removing the need for them to apply for an individual licence, provided the shipment and destinations are eligible and the conditions are met. Each OGEL contains conditions about the type and destinations of goods that may be exported and exporters should check these on each licence before using it. This OGEL allows, subject to certain conditions, the export or transfer goods, software or technology from the United Kingdom to any of the destinations or countries listed in this licence to a government or a NATO organisation. This includes re-exporting goods, software or technology to and from permitted destinations, even if they have been incorporated into other products. This OGEL will mainly be used by exporters who supply military goods, software and technology to a government or a NATO organisation in the listed destinations. Exporters must register with the Export Control Organisation before they make use of most OGELs. All Open General Licences remain in force until they are revoked.</p>

            <p align="justify">Open General Export Licences (OGELs) allow the export of specified controlled items by any exporter, removing the need for them to apply for an individual licence, provided the shipment and destinations are eligible and the conditions are met. Each OGEL contains conditions about the type and destinations of goods that may be exported and exporters should check these on each licence before using it. This OGEL allows, subject to certain conditions, the export of historic military goods from the UK or any other EU member state where the exporter is established in the UK, providing the goods are worth less than £35,000 and were manufactured before 1897. This OGEL also covers reproductions of muzzle-loaded weapons based on originals manufactured before 1897. Exporters must register with the Export Control Organisation before they make use of most OGELs. All Open General Licences remain in force until they are revoked.</p>

                      The Secretary of State has the power to vary or withdraw export licences at any time. If you do not use this licence within any 24-month period for an export allowed by this licence, your entitlement to use it will

                      at the end of that 24-month period and your registration details will be removed from SPIRE. However, you can register for this licence again if you want to use it after your registration has ended.

          <DESCRIPTION>
            <p align="justify">Open General Export Licences (OGELs) allow the export of specified controlled items by any exporter, removing the need for them to apply for an individual licence, provided the shipment and destinations are eligible and the conditions are met. Each OGEL contains conditions about the type and destinations of goods that may be exported and exporters should check these on each licence before using it. The purpose of this Open General Export Licence (OGEL) is to allow you to export military 'components' for military equipment, as long as the original equipment has been exported with the approval of the UK licensing authority (the Export Control Organisation (ECO)) or has been supplied by the UK Government. This OGEL will mainly be used by exporters who need to supply components (goods or software) to maintain or repair equipment held by their customers for the use of the original government end-user.Exporters must register with the Export Control Organisation before they make use of most OGELs. All Open General Licences remain in force until they are revoked.</p>

                      <b>'Project security instructions'</b>
                      are the specific security instructions for a particular project. They are generated either after the signature of a project memorandum of understanding (MoU) involving more than one country or as part of a contractual arrangement. They bring together the security regulations of everyone involved in the project and often provide extra security instructions on classification, marking, release and other security arrangements for that project. A MoU is a document describing an agreement between more than one individual or organisation. It sets out the intended common line of action but does not imply a legal commitment.

This OGEL allows, subject to certain conditions, the export of some military goods for demonstration. Exporters must register with the Export Control Organisation before they make use of most OGELs.
