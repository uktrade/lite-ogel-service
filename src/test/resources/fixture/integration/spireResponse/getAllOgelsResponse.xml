          <NAME>Access Overseas to Software and Technology for Military Goods: Individual Use Only</NAME>
          <DESCRIPTION>
            <p align="justify">Open General Export Licences (OGELs) allow the export of specified controlled items by any exporter, removing the need for them to apply for an individual licence, provided the shipment and destinations are eligible and the conditions are met. Each OGEL contains conditions about the type and destinations of goods that may be exported and exporters should check these on each licence before using it. This OGEL allows , subject to certain conditions, people who would normally be based in the UK, but who are temporarily based abroad, and authorised by their employer, to access their company's technology and IT systems in the UK, via laptops if appropriate, in connection with their company's business. Exporters must register with the Export Control Organisation before they make use of most OGELs. All Open General Licences remain in force until they are revoked.</p>

If an exporter receives written notice to this effect, they will be prevented from relying on this Licence. The power to suspend may be used in addition to criminal prosecution or as an alternative. Suspension may occur for example where an exporter is being investigated or prosecuted in relation to a possible criminal offence, or has been found guilty of a criminal offence under the export control legislation. It may also be used in situations where an exporter has breached the conditions of the Licence and failed to take corrective action within a reasonable period (see Condition 10).</p>
                    <p align="justify">2. Where, the ECO identifies failures in compliance with licence conditions or the legislation during a compliance visit, the ECO may send a warning letter to the exporter listing the improvements that need to be made to ensure compliance. The letter will set out the timeframe within which these improvements must be completed. Failure to complete these improvements may lead to the exporter's ability to use the licence being suspended for a period of time.</p>
                    <p align="justify">3. The exporter may apply for Standard Individual Export Licences during the period of suspension. Suspension will not automatically prevent them from using another OGEL so long as they meet all its terms and conditions and that they have not received a letter suspending or revoking their ability to use that licence.</p>

Where at the end of this initial period, the exporter has not shown compliance to the satisfaction of the Export Control Organisation, the period of suspension or revocation may be extended.

                    <p align="justify">1. The Secretary of State has the power to suspend or revoke licences at any time and in such circumstances and on such terms as they think fit. If an exporter receives written notice to this effect, they will be prevented from relying on this Licence. The power to suspend may be used in addition to criminal prosecution or as an alternative. Suspension may occur for example where an exporter is being investigated or prosecuted in relation to a possible criminal offence, or has been found guilty of a criminal offence under the export control legislation. It may also be used in situations where an exporter has breached the conditions of the Licence and failed to take corrective action within a reasonable period (see Condition 10).</p>
                    <p align="justify">2. Where, the ECO identifies failures in compliance with licence conditions or the legislation during a compliance visit, the ECO may send a warning letter to the exporter listing the improvements that need to be made to ensure compliance. The letter will set out the timeframe within which these improvements must be completed. Failure to complete these improvements may lead to the exporter's ability to use the licence being suspended for a period of time.</p>
                    <p align="justify">3. The exporter may apply for Standard Individual Export Licences during the period of suspension. Suspension will not automatically prevent them from using another OGEL so long as they meet all its terms and conditions and that they have not received a letter suspending or revoking their ability to use that licence.</p>

            <p align="justify">Open General Export Licences (OGELs) allow the export of specified controlled items by any exporter, removing the need for them to apply for an individual licence, provided the shipment and destinations are eligible and the conditions are met. Each OGEL contains conditions about the type and destinations of goods that may be exported and exporters should check these on each licence before using it. This OGEL allows, subject to certain conditions, the export or transfer goods, software or technology from the United Kingdom to any of the destinations or countries listed in this licence to a government or a NATO organisation. This includes re-exporting goods, software or technology to and from permitted destinations, even if they have been incorporated into other products. This OGEL will mainly be used by exporters who supply military goods, software and technology to a government or a NATO organisation in the listed destinations. Exporters must register with the Export Control Organisation before they make use of most OGELs. All Open General Licences remain in force until they are revoked.</p>

          <DESCRIPTION>
            <p align="justify">Open General Export Licences (OGELs) allow the export of specified controlled items by any exporter, removing the need for them to apply for an individual licence, provided the shipment and destinations are eligible and the conditions are met. Each OGEL contains conditions about the type and destinations of goods that may be exported and exporters should check these on each licence before using it. This OGEL allows, subject to certain conditions, the export of historic military goods from the UK or any other EU member state where the exporter is established in the UK, providing the goods are worth less than 35,000 and were manufactured before 1897. This OGEL also covers reproductions of muzzle-loaded weapons based on originals manufactured before 1897. Exporters must register with the Export Control Organisation before they make use of most OGELs. All Open General Licences remain in force until they are revoked.</p>

                    <p align="justify">1. The Secretary of State has the power to suspend or revoke licences at any time and in such circumstances and on such terms as they think fit. If an exporter receives written notice to this effect, they will be prevented from relying on this Licence. The power to suspend may be used in addition to criminal prosecution or as an alternative. Suspension may occur for example where an exporter is being investigated or prosecuted in relation to a possible criminal offence, or has been found guilty of a criminal offence under the export control legislation. It may also be used in situations where an exporter has breached the conditions of the Licence and failed to take corrective action within a reasonable period (see Condition 4).</p>
                    <p align="justify">2. Where, the ECO identifies failures in compliance with licence conditions or the legislation during a compliance visit, the ECO may send a warning letter to the exporter listing the improvements that need to be made to ensure compliance. The letter will set out the timeframe within which these improvements must be completed. Failure to complete these improvements may lead to the exporter's ability to use the licence being suspended for a period of time.</p>
                    <p align="justify">3. The exporter may apply for Standard Individual Export Licences during the period of suspension. Suspension will not automatically prevent them from using another OGEL so long as they meet all its terms and conditions and that they have not received a letter suspending or revoking their ability to use that licence.</p>

The exporter will be notified in writing of any such suspension or revocation and the initial period of such suspension or revocation. Where at the end of this initial period, the exporter has not shown compliance to the satisfaction of the Export Control Organisation, the period of suspension or revocation may be extended.

                    <p align="justify">1. The Secretary of State has the power to suspend or revoke licences at any time and in such circumstances and on such terms as they think fit. If an exporter receives written notice to this effect, they will be prevented from relying on this Licence. The power to suspend may be used in addition to criminal prosecution or as an alternative. Suspension may occur for example where an exporter is being investigated or prosecuted in relation to a possible criminal offence, or has been found guilty of a criminal offence under the export control legislation. It may also be used in situations where an exporter has breached the conditions of the Licence and failed to take corrective action within a reasonable period (see Condition 4).</p>
                    <p align="justify">2. Where, the ECO identifies failures in compliance with licence conditions or the legislation during a compliance visit, the ECO may send a warning letter to the exporter listing the improvements that need to be made to ensure compliance. The letter will set out the timeframe within which these improvements must be completed. Failure to complete these improvements may lead to the exporter's ability to use the licence being suspended for a period of time.</p>
                    <p align="justify">3. The exporter may apply for Standard Individual Export Licences during the period of suspension. Suspension will not automatically prevent them from using another OGEL so long as they meet all its terms and conditions and that they have not received a letter suspending or revoking their ability to use that licence.</p>
